<h1>The TriplX Network</h1>
<h2>What is it?</h2>
TriplX is a series of Minecraft servers linked together to form what is called a Mineraft Network. Using some server-side code, we can make an enjoyable experience for players with Minecraft, giving a twist to playing Singleplayer. With the power of Java and the creative limitless background that Minecraft has, we can provide many different ways to play the game, without the user having to do *anything*. 











TriplX is maintained and owned by Satvik "SStealthy" Mathur, and has not yet been opened to public.
